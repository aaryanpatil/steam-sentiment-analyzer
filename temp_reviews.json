        "review": "No vote in order to bring it closer to what I think it should be. Game is maybe 7/10, especially for a souls game. The trouble with it is that's extremely bloated and far overstays its welcome by drawing things out. It's an enormous kiddie pool with a lot of empty space and not a lot of depth. What you end up with is an experience where you spend most of your time traveling without a lot of action, hit up the necessary bosses and encounters, and make a few pit stops along the way for the things you need while ignoring the roughly 80% of the bland, recycled, and obnoxious filler. There's some 400 weapons and of those weapons maybe 10-20% ever get used. Bosses get repeated often and minor locations are very dull and uninteresting. \n\nThe pacing is also incredibly bi-polar. The first few locations are a breeze, Things pick up a little bit at a time getting into the middle of the game, around the point where you're getting through the capitol. After that things dive off a cliff. Bosses start becoming extremely unforgiving with 9 hit wombo combos, massively inflated damage, and speed and mobility that make them a miserable chore to fight. Regular enemies too gain a jump in health, damage, and poise making them suck considerably more. I've completed this game several times now and every time I want to do a run through I hit a wall right after the capitol where my motivation to continue drops because I remember how unpleasant the last chunk is. There are some exceptions but largely the last third feels rushed and poorly tuned.",

        "review": "Stardew Vallet es un juego que me ha acompa\u00f1ado durante una parte significativa de mi vida. Siempre he tenido mis idas y venidas con este juego por diversos motivos, pero esta vez ha sido diferente. He completado el Centro C\u00edvico casi nueve a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de haberlo comprado debido a mis impulsivas, irrefrenables e incomprensibles ganas de comenzar un archivo nuevo cada vez que regreso. La experiencia es infinitamente mejor cuando se prosigue en un mismo archivo de guardado en vez de crear nuevos, no ha color. \r\n\r\nEste juego lo recomiendo especialmente a aquellos que se quieran introducir a los juegos de gesti\u00f3n o *cozy*, debido a que los m\u00e1s veteranos en este g\u00e9nero ya lo conocer\u00e1n y probablemente le habr\u00e1n puesto varios cientos de horas. Hay tantas opciones y tantos asuntos de los que encargarse, sin ning\u00fan tipo de progresi\u00f3n linear, que puede resultar apabullante en primera instancia, pero es una experiencia que vale la pena vivir. Empaparse del lore del mundo en la biblioteca, ir a la mina cada vez que llueve, cuidar de la granja y pensar en la estaci\u00f3n actual y la que viene, pasar el d\u00eda pescando, hablar con los aldeanos... En definitiva, este juego gira en torno a vivir el momento.",

The peaceful pixelated world is charming, with a town filled with interesting characters to get to know better. The farming mechanics are balanced and there's even dungeons to explore where combat is enabled. The game is designed specifically to be played slowly across the seasons, with events that build up with time. Play it calmly, either by yourself or in co-op, like I did with my brother. To think this title was made by one person is truly mind-blowing!",

I remember Merida and the blackhole it turned into, Malevelon Creek and the hell it was trying to get it back, and so many countless other missions that came after. It has been really fun seeing the game and the community come together with each major order that has come out. The gameplay is engaging, especially on the higher difficulties. Whenever you do get a moment of peace in the chaos of war, the scenery on the planets is absolutely breathtaking. \n\nSadly there are so many issues with the game's performance now that I found it hard to enjoy playing the game for awhile. Thankfully the developers are taking steps to fix some of the issues, and I'm hopefully that things will get better. I'll probably dump another 500 hours into this game regardless of what happens.",

I know some people aren't enjoying it as much to due poor optimization and the devs taking some time to optimize it. Fortunately, my system is good but I still get 30-40 FPS in intense combat compared to the 144 FPS limit I have since this is not a PvP game I don't really mind but with time  it will get better. We just have to cruise for the time being while the devs try to fix this issue. Regardless of its issue, Helldivers 2 is a game I can look forward to playing, mostly alone or not, after a stressful day of college.",

I want everyone to have the same fun as me with the gameplay loop, to enjoy the victories against the enemies of democracy that constantly challenge you (except for squids, but they're probably getting a overhaul soon).\n\n But it is impossible for me to recommend this game on pc to anyone and still have a clear conscience.\n\n A game so filled to the brim with glitches, unstable performance, needless bloated game size (sorry, hdd gamers), constant crashes that not only waste your time having to reopen the game, but often also wasting the time you spent on missions, being unable to rejoin them. And I really wish it could stop there, but the developers constant lack of communication is just so annoying to witness. They are communicating a tiny bit better than before, but it still feels like they don't truly understand the community's concerns a lot of the time, specially when it comes to optimization.\n\n The game has such a fun gameplay system that it can be tolerable - at least for me - but the developers constant decision to ignore issues and change things in the game without stating so just kills part of the respect that I have for AH. Things like adding the factory strider on a April 1st was really funny, but stealth nerfing fire for 20%, which was already weak, just doesn't make sense.\n\n You can have lots of fun in the game if you ignore these issues, and I believe ArrowHead has the capability of changing the things responsible for my complaints. But until then, wait a bit on buying this game. It is a masterpiece and one that I wish everyone can have the opportunity to enjoy in their lifetime.",

The enemies are straightforward, some are lower armor and health all the way to higher armor and health, but the game doesn't punish you for choosing the wrong gear. It only makes things more challenging. The community is one of the most adoptive and friendly I have seen in a long time, and it honestly reminds me of old LAN parties with friends from high school rocking Halo 3 campaign or Left 4 Dead. The developers are very clear with their hopes and involvement with the community, going so far as to have an official (and open!) Discord where they regularly look at feedback from players and work on creating a better game. This level of trust and this level of accountability when something isn't working out is unheard of, and honeslty makes me want to play the game more and more each day. By far my favorite game in my library!",
